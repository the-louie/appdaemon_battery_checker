# Home Assistant Battery Checker

An AppDaemon script that automatically monitors battery levels of all devices in Home Assistant and sends consolidated notifications when batteries are low.

## Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Monitors all battery sensors and binary low battery indicators
- **Smart Filtering**: Excludes non-battery sensors (charging status, power, etc.)
- **Consolidated Notifications**: Sends one message with all low battery devices instead of individual alerts
- **Two-Level Alerts**:
  - Critical: ‚â§10% battery or binary sensors with "islow"
  - Low: ‚â§20% battery or other low battery indicators
- **Daily Scheduling**: Runs automatically at 18:15 daily (configurable)
- **Cooldown Protection**: Prevents notification spam with configurable cooldown periods
- **Action Support**: Users can dismiss notifications for 3 days via mobile app actions
- **Timezone Support**: Configurable timezone for scheduling

## Supported Sensor Types

- **Percentage Sensors**: `sensor.device_battery_level` with values like "15%"
- **Binary Sensors**: `binary_sensor.device_battery_islow` with "on"/"off" states
- **Low Battery Indicators**: Any binary sensor containing "battery", "batt", "islow", or "low_battery"

## Installation

1. Copy `i1_battery_checker.py` to your AppDaemon `apps` directory
